# Sentiment-Analysis-Web
Sentiment Analysis with Long Short Term Memory web deploy with Python and Flask.
First, I created the LSTM model first with Keras and Tensorflow. After that, I loaded the model into the web which was deployed with Flask and Python. 
The sentiment analysis web is connected to Twitter and can search for sentiment according to the keywords entered. 
There is also a visualization of the recapitulation of the types of sentiments obtained and a time series graph.
